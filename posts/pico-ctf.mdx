After watching the [WiCyS Capture the Flag 101 webinar on BrightTALK](https://www.brighttalk.com/webcast/17216/590698), I decided I ought to buckle down and work on CTFs regularly. While I've done a couple before, I never made a writeup alongside it, so I decided to knock out the 'Beginner picoMini 2022' picoCTF and practice my writing.

Without further ado, let's dive into my step-by-step solutions that demonstrate how I tackled each challenge and end with valuable lessons I learned along the way.

## Codebook

> Run the Python script `code.py` in the same directory as `codebook.txt`.

Starting easy, all I had to do was run `python3 code.py`.

## contertme.py

> Run the Python script and convert the given number from decimal to binary to get the flag.

I used an online decimal-to-binary converter with the number I was given after running the Python script, then entered the binary base to get the flag.

## fixme1.py

> Fix the syntax error in this Python script to print the flag.

I ran the script to find which line the syntax error was on, which ended up being an indentation error on the print function line. Opening the file with the command `gedit fixme1.py`, I then fixed the error by deleting the indentation.

```
flag = str_xor(flag_enc, 'enkidu')
print('That is correct! Here\'s your flag: ' + flag)
```

## fixme2.py

> Fix the syntax error in the Python script to print the flag.

Just like in the last exercise, I ran the script to find the error line. I received this error message: SyntaxError: `invalid syntax. Maybe you meant '==' or ':=' instead of '='?`. Using Gedit again, I opened the file and added the missing `=`.

```
if flag == "":
  print('String XOR encountered a problem, quitting.')
```

## Glitch Cat

> Our flag printing service has started glitching!
>
> `$ ncsaturn.picoctf.net52682`

I ran the command in the terminal and received a string with half of the flag. The other half was the "glitched" part, returning a sequence of Python `'chr()'` function calls with hexadecimal values. I created a Python script file with the `print()` function and the sequence. After running my script, the hex values were converted to ASCII characters which completed the entire flag.

## HashingJobApp

> If you want to hash with the best, beat this test!
>
> `$ ncsaturn.picoctf.net53638`

After running the command, I received a message that said, "Please md5 hash the text between quotes, excluding the quotes." Following the message was a random string. Using an online MD5 hash encoder, I generated the hash from the string. Entering the hash into the answer input, I was given a similar message with another string I needed to encode. After answering again, and doing it one more time, I was given the flag.

## PW Crack 1

> Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag in the same directory too.

When running the `level1.py` script, I'm prompted by the console to enter a password for the flag. Looking at the code, I noticed the password is easily found in the if statement following the code for the input prompt.

```
    if( user_pw == "691d"):
```
Copying the password from the code, I reran the script and entered the password into the input, which then returned the flag.

## PW Crack 2

> Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag in the same directory too.

Similar to the last challenge, I took a look at the code of the Python script, and the password is also readily seen. Unlike last time, it's hidden in a sequence of `'chr()'` functions. I copied the functions, then using the print function, I printed the functions to the console right before the password input.

```
    print(chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x65))
    user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
    if( user_pw == chr(0x33) + chr(0x39) + chr(0x63) + chr(0x65) ):
        print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
```

## PW Crack 3

> Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too.
>
> There are 7 potential passwords with 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.

Taking a look at the Python script, I saw the list of possible passwords assigned to the variable pos_pw_list. Rather than inputting the values by hand one at a time, I decided to get a `for` loop to do it. Commenting out the input line, I added `for user_pw in pos_pw_list:` and indented the following lines. I also moved the list of passwords above the function call.

```
def level_3_pw_check():
    # user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
    for user_pw in pos_pw_list:
        user_pw_hash = hash_pw(user_pw)

        if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
            print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
            decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), user_pw)
            print(decryption)
            return
        print("That password is incorrect")

# The strings below are 7 possibilities for the correct password. 
#   (Only 1 is correct)
pos_pw_list = ["6997", "3ac8", "f0ac", "4b17", "ec27", "4e66", "865e"]

level_3_pw_check()
```

## PW Crack 4

> Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too.
>
> There are 100 potential passwords with only 1 being correct. You can find these by examining the password checker script.

In this task, I used a `for` loop like before. I removed the input line and used `for user_pw in pos_pw_list:`, and then I indented the next lines to include them in the loop.

```
...

def level_4_pw_check():
    # user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
    for user_pw in pos_pw_list:
        user_pw_hash = hash_pw(user_pw)

        if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
            print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
            decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), user_pw)
            print(decryption)
            return
        print("That password is incorrect")

# The strings below are 100 possibilities for the correct password. 
#   (Only 1 is correct)
pos_pw_list = ["6288", "6152", "4c7a", "b722", "9a6e", "6717", "4389", "1a28", "37ac", "de4f", "eb28", "351b", "3d58", "948b", "231b", "973a", "a087", "384a", "6d3c", "9065", "725c", "fd60", "4d4f", "6a60", "7213", "93e6", "8c54", "537d", "a1da", "c718", "9de8", "ebe3", "f1c5", "a0bf", "ccab", "4938", "8f97", "3327", "8029", "41f2", "a04f", "c7f9", "b453", "90a5", "25dc", "26b0", "cb42", "de89", "2451", "1dd3", "7f2c", "8919", "f3a9", "b88f", "eaa8", "776a", "6236", "98f5", "492b", "507d", "18e8", "cfb5", "76fd", "6017", "30de", "bbae", "354e", "4013", "3153", "e9cc", "cba9", "25ea", "c06c", "a166", "faf1", "2264", "2179", "cf30", "4b47", "3446", "b213", "88a3", "6253", "db88", "c38c", "a48c", "3e4f", "7208", "9dcb", "fc77", "e2cf", "8552", "f6f8", "7079", "42ef", "391e", "8a6d", "2154", "d964", "49ec"]

level_4_pw_check()
```

## PW Crack 5

> Can you crack the password to get the flag? Download the password checker here and you'll need the encrypted flag and the hash in the same directory too. Here's a dictionary with all possible passwords based on the password conventions we've seen so far.

This task isn't too different from the last two, except, rather than having the password list included in the `level5.py` file, the list of passwords is in a separate `dictionary.txt` file. Inside the `level_5_pw_check()` function, I opened the file and assigned the file object to the `pw_list` variable. Next, I commented out the following line, and then I created a `for` loop to iterate over each line from the list of passwords.

To remove any whitespace in the provided passwords, I used the `strip()` method on the password being iterated over and assigned it to the variable `user_pw`, since I'd removed the original. Finally, I nested the rest of the function into the `for` loop.

```
...

def level_5_pw_check():
    pw_list = open('dictionary.txt')
    # user_pw = input("Please enter correct password for flag: ")
    for password in pw_list:
        user_pw = password.strip()
        user_pw_hash = hash_pw(user_pw)
        print(user_pw_hash)

        if( user_pw_hash == correct_pw_hash ):
            print("Welcome back... your flag, user:")
            decryption = str_xor(flag_enc.decode(), user_pw)
            print(decryption)
            return
        print("That password is incorrect")

level_5_pw_check()
```

## runme.py

> Run the `runme.py` script to get the flag. Download the script with your browser or with `wget` in the webshell.

I simply ran the script using `python3 runme.py`.

## Serpentine

> Find the flag in the Python script!

Running the Python script, I noticed "option `'b'`" is supposed to return the flag, but instead of the flag, a message is returned telling me to check the source code to find the `print_flag` function.

Looking at the code, inside the `print_flag` there's a print function that's supposed to print out a sequence of Python `'chr()'` function calls after converting from hexadecimal values to ASCII characters. I replaced the string that prints in the `'b'` option with the `print_flag()` function call. After running the script again and selecting "option `'b'`," I'm able to access the flag.

```
    elif choice == 'b':
      print_flag()
```

## Lessons Learned

1. I gained greater familiarity with analyzing Python scripts for errors or concealed information.

2. Instead of manually entering values into the password input, I successfully automated the task using for loops.

Overall, the 'Beginner picoMini 2022' CTF challenges were a simple introduction to CTFs and working with Python scripts. By analyzing Python scripts, utilizing online tools, and implementing automation techniques, I was able to practice my problem-solving skills in cybersecurity and programming.
